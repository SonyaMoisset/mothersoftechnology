          p Called the Queen of Software by some and Grandma COBOL by others, Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper helped invent some of the early English-language programming languages. She is most famously associated with the Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), which was based on the FLOW-MATIC language that she designed back in 1958.
          p Before the invention of such language-based programming, computers spoke exclusively in binary code, which was illegible to human beings. Hopper was convinced that if programming were produced in a form that anyone could read, then there would be more programmers. It turns out that she was right.
          p While COBOL isn’t exactly the cutting edge of programming technology today, it still has a faithful following. In fact, in a recent Computerworld survey, 53 percent of the organizations that responded said that they were using COBOL to build new business applications.
          
          h3.mother-subtitle Where is she now?
          p For years, Grace Hopper toured the country, visiting schools and military bases to give lectures on computers and the history of programming languages. She memorably sat down with David Letterman in 1986 and discussed her time spent with the first computer, the Mark I.
          p Hopper died in 1992 at the age of 85.
